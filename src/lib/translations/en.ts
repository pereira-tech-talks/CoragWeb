      'The name comes from <strong>coraje</strong> — courage. The heart replacing the <em>o</em> carries <strong>love</strong>. Our mark is built to transmit courage, innovation and love.<br /><br />Courage here is not bravado. It is showing up when it is inconvenient, putting your name on a delivery, and publishing the account afterwards. That last part is what connects the idea to the product: named responsables, direct transfer and moderated evidence are courage turned into a mechanism. Saying you are transparent is easy; publishing the receipt takes courage.<br /><br />Corag exists because of a simple reality: plenty of people want to give or get involved, but cannot find a way to do it that feels trustworthy, close and meaningful. Generosity is not the scarce resource — connection is.',

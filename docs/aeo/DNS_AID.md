# DNS for AI Discovery (DNS-AID)

Publish HTTPS/SVCB records under the `_agents` namespace so AI agents can
discover Corag before the first HTTP round-trip. This is the remaining gap in
[isitagentready.com](https://isitagentready.com/corag.app) Discoverability.

## What to publish, and where each one points

Two records — and they point at **different hosts**, because the two services
live in different places.

| Type | Name | Priority | Target | SvcParams | Why this target |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| HTTPS | `_index._agents` | 1 | `corag.app` | `alpn="h2,h3" port=443` | This site is the agent-readable index: it serves `/llms.txt`, `/llms-full.txt` and a complete `.md` twin of every page. |
| HTTPS | `_mcp._agents` | 1 | `ayuda.corag.app` | `alpn="h2,h3" port=443` | **Not this site.** `corag.app/mcp` is a 404. The MCP server runs on the application and answers `tools/list` with `listar_emergencias`, `publicar_solicitud`, `publicar_ofrecimiento`. |

Use **ServiceMode** (priority ≥ 1), never AliasMode (priority 0).

> Pointing `_mcp` at `corag.app` — as an earlier version of this document and
> the script both did — advertises an endpoint that does not exist. An agent
> follows the record and gets a 404. Verify a target answers before advertising
> it; this is the DNS form of not publishing a claim you cannot back.

## Option A — the script

```bash
export CF_API_TOKEN='…'           # Zone.DNS Edit (+ Zone.DNSSEC Edit to enable DNSSEC)
export CF_ZONE_NAME='corag.app'    # or CF_ZONE_ID=…

DNS_AID_DRY_RUN=1 node scripts/publish-dns-aid.mjs   # preview, no API calls
node scripts/publish-dns-aid.mjs                     # publish
```

The script upserts both records (safe to re-run) and enables DNSSEC if the token
allows it.

## Option B — Cloudflare dashboard

**corag.app** zone → DNS → Records → **Add record**, once per row in the table
above. Record type **HTTPS**.

## DNSSEC

The zone is **not signed today** — `corag.app` has no DS record, and validating
resolvers return `AD: false`.

1. Cloudflare → DNS → Settings → enable **DNSSEC**.
2. `.app` is a Google Registry TLD. If the registrar is outside Cloudflare, copy
   the DS values Cloudflare shows into the registrar; if the domain is
   registered through Cloudflare, the DS is published automatically.
3. Allow time for the DS to propagate at the registry.

Without DNSSEC the scanner can still see the records, but `dnssecValidated`
stays false and the discovery data is unauthenticated.

## Verify

```bash
# The records resolve (expect a ServiceMode answer, not NXDOMAIN)
dig +short HTTPS _index._agents.corag.app
dig +short HTTPS _mcp._agents.corag.app

curl -s 'https://cloudflare-dns.com/dns-query?name=_index._agents.corag.app&type=HTTPS' \
  -H 'accept: application/dns-json' | jq .

# DNSSEC is signing the zone (expect an Answer with a DS record, and AD: true)
curl -s 'https://dns.google/resolve?name=corag.app&type=DS' | jq '.Status, .Answer'

# The MCP target actually serves MCP before you advertise it
curl -s -X POST https://ayuda.corag.app/mcp \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -H 'accept: application/json, text/event-stream' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}' | head -c 200

# Re-scan
curl -s https://isitagentready.com/api/scan \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"url":"https://corag.app"}' | jq '.checks.discoverability.dnsAid'
```

Expect `status: "pass"` and at least one ServiceMode HTTPS/SVCB answer.

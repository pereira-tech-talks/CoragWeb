# Documentation Index

Documentation for **corag.app** — the site that explains Corag, and the surface
agents read to understand it. The application itself (`ayuda.corag.app`) is a
separate codebase; this repository never holds a real person's need.

## Content collections

Defined in `src/content.config.ts`:

- **blog** — posts with `title`, `description`, `pubDate`, `heroImage`, `tags`,
  `series`, `author`. One file per language, sharing an English slug.
- **pages** — the Markdown twin of every page. Three of them (`conduct`,
  `governance`, `contributing`) are also rendered as the live page bodies, so
  editing them changes the site, not only the agent surface.
- **tags** — three tiers (primary / secondary / subtopic), resolved at build.
- **series** — multi-part collections.
- **authors** — YAML with localized `role` and `bio`.
- **channels** — the official channel inventory.
- **contributors** — the team directory.
- **notifications** — the top banner, with a start and end date.

## Non-obvious things that will catch you

- **New top-level routes must be added to `src/middleware.ts`.** A route missing
  from the allowlist works in dev and 404s in production.
- **The `.md` twin gate measures completeness, not existence.** A summary fails.
- **`parity:check` compares the two languages against each other**, not each
  against correctness. A paragraph added to one side and not the other fails.
- **Route slugs are English in both languages.** Spanish is served unprefixed.
- **The DailyBot form ids come from the environment.** Without them the intake
  endpoint returns 503 and sends nothing, by design.

## Commands

```bash
pnpm run dev                 # http://localhost:9999
pnpm run build               # astro check && astro build
pnpm run biome:check         # lint + format
pnpm run astro:check         # types
pnpm run test                # unit tests
pnpm run md:check:strict     # complete .md twin per page
pnpm run lang:check:strict   # ES at /, EN at /en
pnpm run seo:check:strict    # metadata and structured data
pnpm run parity:check:strict # both languages carry the same content
```

## For AI agents

1. Read [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) — the binding rules.
2. Read [AI Agent Onboarding](AI_AGENT_ONBOARDING.md) — the short checklist.
3. Follow [Standards](STANDARDS.md).
4. Browse `/internal/brand` and `/internal/ui` in dev — the running system is
   the canonical reference for tokens and components, not this folder.

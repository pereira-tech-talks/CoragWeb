# corag.app

**El ecosistema de impacto social.**

This repository is the institutional website for **Corag** — a social-impact
ecosystem connecting foundations, governments, entrepreneurs and individuals with
real opportunities to help, transparently and traceably.

> **Tenemos coraje para servir y transformar vidas.**

## Two surfaces, one project

| Surface | What it is | Repository |
|---|---|---|
| **`corag.app`** | The institutional site: what Corag is, how the model works, why it can be trusted, how to integrate with it. Static, in Spanish and English. | **this repo** |
| **`ayuda.corag.app`** | **Corag Ayuda Directa** — the flagship product. Emergencies, requests, offers, contributions, leaders, evidence. | separate |

Every *transactional* action — publishing a need, offering help, contributing,
tracking a contribution, applying as a leader — happens in the **application**.
This site explains and hands over; it holds no aid data and has no write API.

Getting that split wrong is the most common way to write incorrect copy or code
here. When in doubt: **if it stores something about a real person's need, it
belongs in the app.**

## Stack

- **[Astro](https://astro.build)** — static site generation, islands architecture
- **[Svelte](https://svelte.dev)** — the few genuinely interactive components
- **[Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com)** — with the Corag `@theme` tokens
- **TypeScript** — pinned to 6.x on purpose (see `AGENTS.md`)
- **[Biome](https://biomejs.dev)** — linting and formatting (never ESLint/Prettier)
- **[Vitest](https://vitest.dev)** — unit tests
- **Cloudflare Pages** — hosting, plus Pages Functions for the contact forms

Markdown is compiled by **Sätteri**; transforms are HAST plugins in
`src/lib/satteri-plugins.ts`. Never add remark/rehype plugins.

## Getting started

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev          # http://localhost:9999
```

### Everyday commands

```bash
pnpm run build                # astro check && astro build
pnpm run astro:preview        # serve the production build

pnpm run biome:check          # lint + format
pnpm run biome:fix            # auto-fix
pnpm run astro:check          # TypeScript
pnpm run test                 # Vitest
pnpm run test:coverage
```

### Content and quality gates

```bash
pnpm run md:check:strict      # every page has a COMPLETE .md twin
pnpm run lang:check:strict    # Spanish at /, English at /en
pnpm run seo:check:strict     # per-URL SEO + structured data
pnpm run parity:check:strict  # both languages carry the same content
pnpm run search:budgets       # search payload budgets
pnpm run lighthouse
```

### Brand assets

Shipped assets are **derived by script** from the official masters in
`assets/brand/`, so the pipeline is reproducible:

```bash
node scripts/build-brand-assets.mjs --dry-run
node scripts/build-brand-assets.mjs
```

---

## Language support

Spanish is the **primary** language and is served at the root (`/`). English is
served under `/en`. Both carry the same content — the same sources, the same
structure — not merely correct content in each.

Spanish is also the **source** language: copy is written in Spanish first and
translated to English, never the reverse. Diacritics are mandatory.

.agents/            skills, agents, commands for AI assistants
```

### The page-wrapper pattern

Every route is a **3-line wrapper** delegating to a shared page component:

```astro
---
import HomePage from '@/components/pages/HomePage.astro';
---
<HomePage lang="es" />
```

Wrappers never import `MainLayout`, and `lang` is always a string literal.

> ⚠️ **New top-level routes must be registered in `src/middleware.ts`**
> (`KNOWN_ROOT_PATHS` / `KNOWN_EN_PATHS`) or they 404 in production while working
> fine in dev.

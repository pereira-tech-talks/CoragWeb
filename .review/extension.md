# AI Diff Reviewer — repo extension for `corag.app` v3

> Layered on top of the shipped default review prompt. Anchors severity to this
> repo's real conventions (Astro 7 SSG + Svelte 5 islands + TS 6 + Tailwind 4
> `@theme` Corag tokens + Biome 2, pnpm, bilingual ES-primary/EN static site on
> Cloudflare Pages). Adapt as conventions evolve — see `AGENTS.md`.

## Severity overrides for this codebase

- **Always `critical`:**
  - **Design token override.** Setting `--color-corag-*` outside
    `src/styles/global.css` — including an inline
    `style="--color-corag-primary: …"` on a component. The palette is declared
    once and every surface reads it.
  - **New top-level route not in the middleware allowlist.** A new page under
    `src/pages/` (or `src/pages/en/`) without a matching entry in
    `src/middleware.ts` (`KNOWN_ROOT_PATHS` / `KNOWN_EN_PATHS`) — the route 404s in
    production until allowlisted.
  - **DailyBot form or question ids hardcoded in source.** They come from
    `DAILYBOT_CONTACT_FORM` / `DAILYBOT_CONDUCT_FORM` and must fail closed when
    absent; a baked-in id can post real submissions into the wrong workspace.
  - **Personal data collected on this site.** Any form field asking about a
    specific person's need, location or situation belongs in the application,
    not in this repository.
  - **remark/rehype reintroduced into the Markdown pipeline.** Adding
    `markdown.remarkPlugins` / `rehypePlugins` / `remarkRehype` to `astro.config.mjs`,
    switching `markdown.processor` back to `unified()`, or adding a `rehype-*` /
    `remark-*` / `unist-*` dependency. This repo compiles Markdown with **Sätteri**
    (`markdown.processor: satteri({ hastPlugins: [...] })`), which does not run
    remark/rehype plugins — the transform silently never runs. Port it to a HAST
    plugin in `src/lib/satteri-plugins.ts` instead.
  - **Placeholder content shipped.** `[AUTHOR:`, `[AUTOR:`, `[TODO:`, `[TBD]`,
    `[FIXME]` or any bracketed "fill-in-later" text in `src/content/**`.
  - **Secret committed.** Any API key / token / `PUBLIC_GOOGLE_SITE_VERIFICATION`
    (banned per the analytics policy), or a `google-site-verification` meta tag in a
    template/component.
  - **i18n content added in only one language.** A blog post or page twin added
    under `es/` (or `en/`) without its counterpart, or a new UI string added to
    `src/lib/translations/es.ts` but not `en.ts` (or vice versa).
  - **A new top-level route with no `src/middleware.ts` entry.** The page works
    in dev and 404s in production — this is a silent production break.
  - **An unverifiable claim shipped in content.** A statistic with no source, an
    organization named as trustworthy, or a CTA to a channel Corag does not run
    (only Facebook, Instagram and the WhatsApp group exist).

- **Escalate to `warning`:**
  - **Failing WCAG AA text colour** for body/secondary text: `text-gray-400`,
    `text-gray-500`, `dark:text-gray-400`, `dark:text-gray-500`, or
    `--color-corag-accent` used for body text. Approved secondary text is
    `text-corag-secondary`.
  - **`bg-corag-primary` paired with `text-white`.** The brand foreground flips
    to rosa in dark mode; that pair measures roughly 1.5:1 there. Use
    `bg-corag-fill` with `text-corag-on-fill`, which does not flip.
  - **`<img>` without `width` and `height`** (causes layout shift; also an a11y rule here).
  - **Hardcoded user-visible string** in a template/component instead of
    `getTranslations(lang)` — or a hardcoded URL instead of `getUrlPrefix(lang)`.
  - **Interactive logic in a `.astro` file** that should be a Svelte island, or a
    Svelte component used without a `client:*` directive, or `client:load` where
    `client:visible` / `client:idle` would suffice.
  - **Page wrapper importing `MainLayout`** directly (layout belongs inside the
    `*Page.astro` component), or `lang` passed as a variable instead of a string literal.
  - **Non-English slug** for a blog post, a series or a route
    (`YYYY-MM-DD_slug.md` must use an English slug in both languages).
  - **Page copy changed without its `.md` twin.** `md:check` measures coverage,
    so a twin that lost a section fails the gate.
  - **Spanish content missing diacritics** — e.g. `codigo`, `version`, `pagina`,
    `analisis`, `manana`, `espanol`, `diseno` in `src/content/**` or `es.ts`.
  - **`MainLayout` used for an `/internal/**` page** (must use `InternalLayout` /
    `ShowcaseLayout`), or a public page referencing an `/internal/` route.

- **De-escalate to `info` (or omit):**
  - Anything Biome already enforces — formatting, import ordering, quote style.
    Biome is the CI gate (`pnpm run biome:check`); the reviewer should not duplicate it.
  - Pure TypeScript type errors — `pnpm run astro:check` gates these in CI.

## Don't comment on

- Generated/optimized image binaries under `public/images/**`.
- Demo blog content under `_demo/` folders (never shipped in listings/search).
- ESLint/Prettier suggestions — this project uses **Biome exclusively**; do not
  recommend ESLint or Prettier.
- Vendored agent tooling under `.agents/skills/**` and `.dwp/**` — not application code.

## Repo-specific conventions

- **Pages** = 1 shared `*Page.astro` in `src/components/pages/` + thin 3-line wrappers
  in `src/pages/` (ES, served at `/`) and `src/pages/en/` (EN, served at `/en`). Flag deviations as `warning`.
- **Content** lives in Astro Content Collections with Zod schemas in
  `src/content.config.ts`; new fields must be added to the schema.
- **Markdown-for-Agents twins:** when page/translation content changes, the matching
  `src/content/pages/{en,es}/*.md` must be updated in the same change (`pnpm run md:check`).
- **Corag tokens** (`text-corag`, `bg-corag-bg`, `border-corag-border`, `text-corag-secondary`)
  on new components — not raw non-Corag design tokens.
- **Real validation gate** the diff should pass:
  `pnpm run biome:check && pnpm run astro:check && pnpm run test && pnpm run build`
  plus, for anything touching content or copy:
  `pnpm run md:check:strict && pnpm run lang:check:strict && pnpm run seo:check:strict && pnpm run parity:check:strict`.
  Cite the specific gate when a change plausibly breaks it.
- **Commits** follow Conventional Commits with this repo's scopes
  (`brand`, `blog`, `pages`, `forms`, `i18n`, `a11y`, `seo`, `docs`, …).
